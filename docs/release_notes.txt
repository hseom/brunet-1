===============================================================================
Revision 9.5.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- OnDemand will only close a connection if the node created it, the token
  determines the node that created the connection
- Fixed a bug in Linux, where resolv.conf had a bad entry, and
  Dns.GetHostAddresses in IPHandler would block, causing Brunet to not work
- Disabled testing of DTLS in the simulator
- Reduced the time in the dump / load dht proxy scripts from 60 to 15
===============================================================================
Revision 9.5.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- OnDemand was using a potentially null object in the LinkerEndHandler - could
  create poorly handled exceptions
- Removed unused code from RpcManager
- In AHSender, merged protected readonly with public accessors into public
  readonly
- Added an overlay testing suite for hops, drop rate, and latency
- AHSenders when being used as a return from will return the amount of Hops
  between the source and destination
===============================================================================
Revision 9.5.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- (This was a bug fixed in 9.4.13 but must have been missed in the switch to
  the new repository) - In UdpEL, unhandled exception, some packets may be too
  large to fit into the buffer
===============================================================================
Revision 9.5.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Replaced Chota with an OnDemandCO creater, much better for GroupVPN
- IPOP uses TAAuth so that Brunet doesn't attempt to connect over IPOP
- Made a TimeBasedCache based upon the work used on DhtAddressResolver
- Ported the DhtAddressResolver to use this Cache
- loading and dumping of the Dht could block infinitely, now its based upon a
  60 second timer, afterwhich point it gives up
===============================================================================
Revision 9.5.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Increased security timeouts to 7.5, 15 minutes
- Decreased security failure timeouts to 2 minutes
- Fixed a simulator bug
- RpcDhtProxy stores values across restarts
- In Debian, when installing a new GroupVPN, it will restart itself if it is
  currently running
- ipop.vpn.config shouldn't be overwritten in Debian any more
- hostname updating handled when USE_IPOP_HOSTNAME is set
===============================================================================
Revision 9.5.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- First version using new Brunet core
- Xmpp bootstrapping support
- PathEdgeListeners to support multiplexing of a single EdgeListener across
  many Nodes
- Cleaned up BasicNode and its application in inherited classes
- IP <=> Brunet Address translation more scalable and better handled
- Rewrote security stack for simplicity
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.13
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Throwing an exception in the Send loop of UDP causes a memory leak
- Check UDP packet size before parsing
- In UdpEL, unhandled exception, some packets may be too large to fit into the
  buffer
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- In Ubuntu, when performing self-domainname lookup, it performs AAAA
  searches waaay before performing A searches, this creates significant delay
  on operations that rely on self-lookups.  This patch assumes that an AAAA
  search will be happy with an IPv4 address being returned.  The current code
  cannot handle IPv6 addresses.
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.11
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Made Udp Send run in its own loop, in previous code, the Udp was blocking
  causing weird delays in the system and breaking usefulness of IPOP.
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- StaticDns is case insensitive
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- In UDP, new Edges weren't being notified of their proper address mapping via
  the remote EdgeListener as soon as they were created, which was preventing
  NAT traversal.  I guess the same behavior should probably be added to the
  TCP module, otherwise port forwarding and DMZ will fail for it as well.
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- If a proper lc.* certificate is in the certs dir but doesn't match the
  current node's node id, it won't muck things up
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a rare bug in Brunet, which would effectively kill the system
- UdpEL wasn't updating RemoteTAs properly
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Broke Dns configuration in previous release
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug in Local TA Discovery (was broken)
- Improved daemon script
- Added a recursive Dns system useful when resolvconf isn't installed or the
  resolver stops after the first entry (more and more modern Linux
  distributions are displaying this behavior)
- Directory restructuring to match namespace
- Last feature version before 9.5, this will become maintained for a short
  time for maintenance purposes
- Renamed files/classes to support better mapping to C# naming style, this was
  done to make porting (potential) back and forth between versions easier
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Shortcut contruction is explicit on outgoing packets now
- Rewrote groupvpn_prepare.sh to notify of errors on parsing a config.zip
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- No longer forwarding Brunet based multicast packets
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Improved connectivity:
- Changed the ordering of TAs to ensure that Tunnel and TCP TAs are sent
- Increased the number of TAs sent
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Improved direct connectivity detector, though this is in testing state
- Remote peers notify a VPN end-point if its DHT registration failed
===============================================================================
Revision 9.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Memory leaks have been fixed
- Added MapReduce
- Fixed a bug that resulted in occasional slow connectivity to the overlay
- Fixed in the XmlRpc Dht interface that was returning only a single get result
- GroupVPN supports revocation through the web interface and a CRL
===============================================================================
Revision 9.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Removed UidGenerator and creation of many sender types via SenderFactory
until memory leaks are fixed
- Improved Ethernet sending to be threadsafe
- Improved Ethernet reading to better handle exceptions
- Logging is now enabled for GroupVPN
- Multicast and broadcast support fixed since IpopRouter inclusion
- GroupVPN supports a user revocation list
===============================================================================
Revision 9.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- More fixes for Brunet
- GroupVPN handles the case when a private key is broken
===============================================================================
Revision 9.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
